# Domus Mea Finance site
Domus Mea Finance is still in the process of building their brand name and online presence. 
Setting up a new website is an important step for the company - it will serve as the face of the business, showcasing the company's competence and professionalism and, of course, facilitate contact between new clients and the company.

## UX

### User Stories
1. As the site user I can easily understand the purpose of the site and the nature of the business.
2. As a user I can easily find information about the various services the company offers and focus on those relevant to me.
3. As a user I can easily locate contact information at any point in my journey. I can get in touch with the company in several different ways, including phone, e-mail and contact form, whichever suits me best.
4. As a user I want to have the same experience and ease of navigation on mobile devices and desktop.

### Bugs and fixes:

## User Testing

As the site user I can easily understand the purpose of the site and the nature of the business.
This is achieved by:
- relevant imagery, tag line in the header;
- services overview placed right under the header of the Home Page.

As a user I can easily find information about the various services the company offers and focus on those relevant to me.
This is achieved by:
- links from services overview in the Home Page to specific sections in the Services page;
- minimalisation of scrolling through the use of accordion on Services page and Back to top links.

As a user I can easily locate contact information at any point in my journey. I can get in touch with the company in several different ways, including phone, e-mail and contact form, whichever suits me best.
This is achived by implementation of:
- sticky footer to show contact info at all times;
- separate Contact Us page with contact form and the company address.

As a user I want to have the same experience and ease of navigation on mobile devices and desktop. 
This is achived by:
- implementation of different header design for laptops/tablets and mobiles;
- resising and adjusting the laout of images/text to better fit mobiles.
