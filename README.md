# Domus Mea Finance site
Domus Mea Finance is still in the process of building their brand name and online presence. 
Setting up a new website is an important step for the company. The site will serve as the face of the business, showcasing the company's competence and professionalism, provide information about the services the company offers and facilitate contact between new clients and the company.

### Design

#### Scope

As a starting point, the website is composed of three pages: Home Page, Services and Contact Us page in English. 
This set up allows a quick launch of site as an MVP to achieve its main purpose - increasing the company's online presence and reaching more potential customers. 

The initial scope and ideas about the layout were captured in [wireframes](assets/data/Domus_mea_finance-revised.pdf) at the start of the project. 

As the project progressed certain changes were applied to increase the value for the user: 
- Swapped _Why Choose Us?_ and _Services_ sections on __Home Page__, to make the site's purpose clearer on first access.
- Merged the _About Us_ content that was to be right under the hero image with the _Why Choose Us?_ section.
- _What Our Client's Say?_ section is presented as a simple row of images with reviews at the moment, rather than a carousel. This might be revised at a later stage when more recommendations are available.
- Simplified __Services__ page to better match the amount of available content.
- Considering restrictions on in-person meetings due to the Covid-19 situation, _Where to Find Us_ changed to _Our Address_ on __Contact Page__ without the map for the time being. This might be updated to include Google Maps in the future. 

## Features

### General Features

The website includes the following features: 

#### Header and Footer
Header and footer remain the same across all pages and are fully responsive. 

##### Header features:
- navigation bar at the top with the name of the current page highlighted and a hover animation
- hero image, logo and tagline providing a quick introduction of the business purpose.

##### Footer features:
- company contact details: e-mail address, telephone number and links to social media.
- The e-mail and telephone number are linked to the email and phone clients to facilitate contact directly from the site.
- _Recommend Us on Social Media_ section with links to the social media sites. For the purpose of the course the links are generic but on live site, they will be linked to the company profiles.

The header and footer layout changes to fit in the mobile devices. Screenshots of these are available here: 
- [Desktop layout](assets/data/Large_header_and_footer.png)
- [Mobile layout](assets/data/Small_header_and_footer.png)

#### Home Page: 
__Home Page__ contains the following information: 
- _Our Services_ section with general overview of the three main types of services offered &ndash; mortgages, equity release and protection (or insurance). At the end of each introductory text there is a link to the specific section on that service on the ==Services page==.
- _Why Chose Us?_ section with information about the company, their ethos, experience - the company's selling pitch.
- _What Clients Say?_ section contains reviews lifted from the business's social media sites. 
- _Accredited By_ section with logos of the organisation from which the company received accreditation and is a member of. These link to the organisations' sites, which open in another tab.

The content of each section has been adjusted for viewing on smaller screens: the sections with a row of three images (_Our Services_ and _What Our Clients Say?_) switch to a view of a single image per row with; the text content presented as two columns switches to one column and the _Accredited By_ section becomes hidden.

#### Services: 
This page is split into 3 separate sections with more details about each service type and their sub-types.

##### Mortgages section - accordion:
Being the core service offered by the business, this appears first. 
Having considered that there are 6 types of this service, and the amount of text describing each, I decided to use accordions allowing the user to select the service they would like to read about and hide other content from view. This way the user is not forced to scroll through a lot of irrelevant content while searching for what is of interest to them. 
Residential mortgages, being most of the the company's business, were chosen as the section visible to the user when  first loading the page.

The accordion showing on the larger devices (over 700px) is different to that used on smaller devices and both have been scripted using only CSS (radio-buttons with transition and display: none methods, using inspiration and ideas from an existing site and a tutorial, see [Credits](#credits) section below).

The initial idea for an accordion was a bit different to the final design. The accordion worked similarly but was arranged with labels running vertically on the side of individual divs, which my mentor recommended to change to improve user experience since it caused difficulty reading. 

##### Equity Release and Protection sections: 
These are relatively text-heavy, therefore are presented on larger screens as two columns and one column on smaller ones. 
Rather than using 'columns' within a paragraph, I used div elements to have greater control over how the text is split when the screen size changes. 

#### Contact Us Page: 

__Contact Us__ page offers the user an option to contact the company using contact form.
It includes front-end validation of input: 
- name, e-mail and telephone number are set to required values;
- e-mail requires an email format;
- at least one option must be selected in 'What are you interested in?' to be able to submit the form.

As expected, at present the form is not connected to any database. 

### Features Left to Implement
- Cookies to track traffic and GDPR information on form
- A Polish version of the site
- Section linking to industry news
- Add highlight/colour to the selected label in the large accordion
- adjust design for Dark mode

## Technologies Used

### Languages
- HTML
- CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs used

- VS Code: used as the primary code editor
- Git: used for version control
- Git Hub: used to store project files
- Google Fonts: used to import fonts used in the project: Nunito and Relay
- Font Awesome: used for the social links icons in the footer
- Affinity Designer: to resize and adjust the images for the website
- Balsamiq: to create wireframes
- Lighthouse (Chrome extension): used to check the performance and accessibility of the website
- JS-CSS-HTML Formatter (VS Code extension): used to beautify the HTML and CSS code
- Dev Tools on Chrome and Safari: used for code testing and trials

## Testing

### Testing performance
1. W3C Markup Validator - [Results](assets/data/HTML_validation.pdf)
2. W3C CSS Validator - [Results](assets/data/CSS_Validation.pdf)
    - the validator picked up 13 errors all relating to the use of -webkit elements. Considering compatibility with different browsers a priority, I decided to ignore these warnings and keep these elements.
3. Run Lighthouse extension to check site performance. Results: [Home Page](assets/data/Lighthouse_Report_HomePage.pdf), [Services](assets/data/Lighthouse_Report_Services.pdf), [Contact Us](assets/data/Lighthouse_Report_Contact-Us.pdf)
4. Tested the form and all devices listed below
5. Tested for responsiveness and display on various devices: 
    - Android (Samsung S8, Samsung Note8, Xiaomi)
    - iOS (iPhone S6) 
    - iPad Pro 9.7 inch
    - Microsoft Surf 11 inch
    and browsers:
    - Safari
    - Chrome 
    - Firefox
    - Edge
    - Opera

#### Bugs and fixes: 
- Labels in large accordion on the Services page were not showing vertically on Safari; fixed issue by adding 'display: inline-block;' to .accordion-h.
- On iPad Pro 9.7 inch in portrait view, the gap between the two columns in section using this layout was not visible; fixed by changing 'gap' styling to 'padding'.
- In the Contact form, telephone number did not allow for a format with country code using '+'. Changed field type from number to 'tel'.
- The images in _Our Services_ section on __Home Page__ when resizing the screen were pushed out of line. To fix it, changed the layout to fit text and images in separate divs on larger screens. 
- The fix above caused and issue with the images no longer being visible on mobile. Fixed by duplicating the images in the paragraphs and setting them to 'display:none;' on larger screens.
- The site does not have enough contrast when viewed in dark mode. This is still to be investigated.
